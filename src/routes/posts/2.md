Hey everyone! Finally coming back to this blog after spending a day setting it up a few months ago.
I'm playing around with the post styling on the main page and I've added an RSS feed.
I figure that's probably the easiest way for anyone who's actually interested to keep up with new posts here.
I'll try and post on Twitter also if it's anything of note, but the RSS feed will be a sure thing.

So what's the deal? What am I actually going to be posting here, assuming I actually start making use of this?
I think I'll try to make this a place for devlogs and maybe just some general thoughts I'll have from time to time.
There's a couple projects I've had shelved for a bit that I'm looking to revive, so expect to hear some news on that soon.

Anyways, I don't know how to end blog posts, so thanks for reading. I hope I'll have more to share with you soon.
