To anyone that happens to be reading this, hello.
After much delay I've finally gotten around to making a simple blog on my website.
I'm not quite sure yet what I want to post here; I think I'll use it post some devlogs and occasional thoughts.
I've been thinking about making some instructional WebXR videos in the future, so I could potentially post some text versions here as well.
